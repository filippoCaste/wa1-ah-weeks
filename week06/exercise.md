# Exercise 7: React page for Q&A

_Goal: First steps with React applications. Create a page based on a tree of components (and props)._

## Creating a project

Create a new React project called `QA`, activate it and explore the files. Insert into App.jsx the code for loading the 'fake' set of questions and answers in JavaScript objects.

Note: use the export/import syntax to access the constructor functions.


## Defining the component tree

Starting from a "screen" of the desired application (see Ex 6), make a list of the components that you need to recreate the HeapOverrun question page.

For each component, list the information (`prop`s) that are required by that component (and/or by any other enclosed component).

## Implementing the components

Create a file `Components.jsx`, and define the  React components as functions, and modify the App to render those components.

The components should **not** be interactive, yet.
